5 Card Video Poker: Jacks or Better
in the function "fill_in_cards" (starts line 79) the card image is using a file in my directory ("C:\\ico\\PNG-cards-1.3\\) . User might need to change the directory path so that the cards show up. I have uploaded all the card images in this repository. 

The icon for the window (line 10) is also in ""C:\\ico\\" so may need to change that too.
